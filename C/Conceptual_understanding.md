### Declaration vs Definition

```bash
int i; --> Declaration + Definition
extern int i; --> Only Declaration
```
**Declaration**
- Tells the compiler that I have a variable of **Data type** (integer in above case). But don't allocate any memory to it as of now.

**Definition**
- **Declaration** + Allocate memory of specified **Data type**
